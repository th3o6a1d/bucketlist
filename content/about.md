The origins of the phrase ["kicking the bucket"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_the_bucket) remain unclear. Whether the "bucket" refers to the makeshift footstool on which a man would stand before hanging, or a vessel for holy water brought to wash the feet of corpses, there's something satisfying about the idea of kicking something on the way out. 

**But before I kick the bucket, I plan on kicking some serious ass.** 

To all those living this short, fragile life to the fullest, may you accomplish your goals and live richly.
