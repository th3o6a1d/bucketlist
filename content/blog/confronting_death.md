["The Remarkable Death and Life of John Shields"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/canada/euthanasia-bill-john-shields-death.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)

One of my loved ones used to always say about parties, "Leave on a high note." 

I just watched a short documentary about a man with a terminal illness who ended his own life via assisted suicide in Canada. 

While I hope to never be in this position, I admire that he chose to leave on a high, presumably after he felt he had gotten what he needed to get out of life. 

I hope to live in such a way that when the returns of daily living start to diminish and decline, I'll feel no urge to prolong a life of worsening quality in order to take care of unfinished business.
