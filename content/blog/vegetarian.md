I'm not a particularly "body-conscious" eater. Nor do I have a problem with eating tasty animals. But so many people in my life have gone vegetarian or vegan that I thought it'd be worth a try. The trick will be to not substitute carbs for meat, as I know I would have no problem finding grains and starches to fill the void. 

Here's what I've been eating over the course of the past two weeks:

Strategy: 

- Trader Joe's veggie dumplings and masala burgers

- Smoothies (greek yogurt, peanut butter, strawberries, mangoes, whey protein powder)

- Hummus with whole wheat bread

- Coffee and tea

- Bananas

- Veggie pizza

- Hard boiled eggs. Breakfast burritos with no sausage. 

- Dr. Daniel's vegetarian dishes -- I have an attending who makes Indian food for the residents at work. She recently gave me a bag of brown basmati rice and literally made me order a rice cooker from Amazon. 


How do I feel?

Besides a little hungrier? Not bad at all. But not significantly different. Don't think I lost much weight or gained much lean muscle mass. Two weeks is probably too short of a time period, but 

Next up...Vegan for 2 weeks.
