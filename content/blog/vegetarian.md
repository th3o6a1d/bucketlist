I'm not a particularly "body-conscious" eater. Nor do I have a problem with eating tasty animals. But so many people in my life have gone vegetarian or vegan that I thought it'd be worth a try. The trick will be to not substitute carbs for meat, as I know I would have no problem finding grains and starches to fill the void. 

Here's what I've been eating over the course of the past two weeks:

Strategy: 

- Trader Joe's veggie dumplings and masala burgers

- Smoothies (greek yogurt, peanut butter, strawberries, mangoes, whey protein powder)

- Hummus with whole wheat bread

- Coffee and tea

- Bananas


How do I feel?

Besides a little hungrier? Not bad at all. But not significantly different. 

Next up...Vegan for 2 weeks.
