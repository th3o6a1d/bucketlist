1001 Reasons I left the Mormon Church 


- "A lot can happen in a billion years." When I was in high school, I was under the mistaken impression that to pass AP biology, I had to read the entire Campbell biology textbook. The book was a college-level beast that took students through the origins of life, evolution, ecology, and cell biology. Being exceedingly diligent at Brophy College Prep, I chipped away at it page by page. 


- The Book of Mormon 

- Life after death

- At times during my mission in Pittsburg, I felt like a zombie, walking around preaching the gospel with my lips while my mind wrestled with questions about doctrine. With a blank stare, I lumbered from door to door while my CPU was stuck processing an infinite loop of spiritual point and counterpoint. I seemed to be incapable of suppressing doubtful thoughts. Any time I'd offer a faith-promoting statement or testimony, an equally negative, soul-draining idea would pop into my head. 

It felt like a devil was sitting on my shoulder. Attempts to settle my mind with study seemed to only supply him with more nagging questions. At this point, an active member would likely chime in and confirm that such opposition is to be expected during a mission...but this didn't feel like run-of-the-mill temptation. This was debilitating, like a terrible song that you just can't get out of your head. I wondered if this was perhaps a mental deficiency instead of a spiritual one. 

After speaking to my mission president, I was referred to a church psychiatrist who believed what I was describing to him resembled the incessant, intrusive thoughts of someone on the OCD-spectrum. He put me on a starter dose of zoloft, which I stopped taking a few weeks after it was prescribed. While I accepted that his assessment might have been correct, the implications of the answer produced a significant amount of anxiety. If I'm suddenly able to consistently express faith because a pill has quieted doubtful, intrusive thoughts, then who am I, really? Who is the faithful missionary? Me or zoloft? More generally, when someone does something that is considered "good" or "evil", does the responsibility fall to the spirit or the mind?

In medical school, I worked on the forensic psychiatry inpatient unit at Bellevue Hospital. It was a locked ward where acutely psychotic patients get started on meds so that they no longer pose a threat to themselves or their fellow inmates at Rikers. One of the rules of the ward was to always keep a door between you and the patient, and preferably a table. Meeting a gentle, quiet man who I later found out had killed his son because "the voices told him to" stirred up all sorts of thoughts about the nature of good and evil. 

One of the most troubling aspects of Mormonism for me has always been the duality of the spirit and the mind. Peoples' actions make so much more sense when they are the product of the brain and the brain alone, not some interaction between the brain and the spirit. The concept of a person having free will does not jive with the reality of mental illness, or for a less extreme example, the conditioning a brain undergoes when its raised in an abusive home. The man who killed his son? It's silly to say things like, "His mind is sick, but deep down, his soul is good." What is the utility of a statement like that? The sober truth of the matter is that he is his brain, and his brain is neither good nor evil -- it's defective. 

I accepted that perhaps my brain was a little defective, but refused to let anyone but God fix it directly, without pharmacology. After my meeting with the mission psychiatrist, I decided to keep on keepin' on, drug-free. I'll admit that pressing forward wasn't just a matter of faith. Going home carried so much social stigma and potential for disruption of my college plan that I did not seriously entertain it as an option. Day after day, I put on my shirt and tie, hoping I could feel good about what I was doing and preach with the honesty of a true believer. 

Meeting a non-member with a similar internal struggle helped me realize that I wasn't alone. One very cold night, I was knocking on doors in Pittsburgh when a guy my age came to the door. He was home for the night, taking care of his terminally-ill mother. I asked him a generic question that put him into an unexpectedly profound state of thought. A philosophy major in college, he had gone down the rabbit hole created by Plato and the greats, reasoning through various interpretations of reality, all in the context of watching his mother die. The journey had been overwhelming and paralyzing. At rock bottom, he started to wonder if anything was real. After reaching a breaking point, he stopped trying to figure it all out. He fell back to a few simple truths that resonated with him, like the need for devotion to his mother, a general feeling that the universe is benevolent, and a desire to pray periodically. 

After leaving his house, I had the distinctly comforting feeling that no one really knows what is going on in life. We are all on this sinking ship together. It wasn't until after my mission that I understood what this unknown guy meant by reaching a breaking point. There's a threshold at which the desire to know or understand why we are here is not worth the agony of the pursuit. Reaching the threshold is made significantly easier when you accept the idea that no one really does know. 












I met a young family during my mission in Pittsburg. Five years into their beautiful temple marriage, with three little children sitting in the pews, the patriarch gradually drifted away from the Church. It was heartbreaking to see a young mother hauling the little ones to Sunday School by herself. I knew when I returned from my mission, a temple marriage would not be an option until I knew for sure that I would never desert someone who expected a life in the covenant. Problem is, I never had that sort of confidence in myself. 


Why do bad things happen to good people? There is no reason. Tragedy and good fortune strike randomly, like the collision of water molecules. The shitty things that happen in life are not part of a convoluted plan to give my premature spirit worldly experience. Nor can I take credit for anything good as a blessing earned by past deeds. There's simply no need to look for an explanation. 

One night at St. Luke's, we had seven gunshot victims in one night. Six escaped with minor images to their extremitiessao
